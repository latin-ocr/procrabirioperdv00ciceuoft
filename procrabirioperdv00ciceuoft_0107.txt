and was employed by Saturninus& against Metellus and by
Clodius against Cicero.

iii. The man was outlawed in the usual form, a limit was

b* - named, but the execution of the sentence does not seem to

 

 

have been enforced by rewards or penalties as in the above.
The outlaw might be put to death by anyone without sear os
punishment. Thus a public penalty was lest to be carried
out by the capricious action os private hatred. This was a
peculial· form os outlawry applied to secondary offenders, the
succourers os those outlawed under (ii). But, while the
harder forms os outlawry were only used in sentences pro-
nounoed by iudicia populi, it seems most probable that this
form was also the ‘capital penalty’ os the permanent jury
courts. Instances of this are to be found in the cases os (a)
the risk run⁸⁴ by the friends os Cicero in giving him succour
(b) the cases os the elder Oppianicus and os VerreS, as simple
criminals.

The„ consequences os these different degrees of outlawry
would be roepectively (i) Death or the imminent risk os it,
(ii) Exile, (iii) A certain amount of risk of death, to be avoided
by exile, and generally a wretched despised outcast existence.

1t is interesting in this connexion to consider the expres-
siens employed by Cicero in the perorations os his speeches
on behalf os men accused on capital charges before the jury
cour-ts. We find that in such cases as that os Sextus Roscius
and that os Cluentius he speaks¹⁸ os the accused as standing
in danger ol' his life. In such as those os Sulla Sestius
Caelius and Plancius he lays¹⁶ the stress on the banishment
which must follow condemnation. The difference is to be
accounted sor by observing that the former were merely cases
of ordinary crime, while the latter were essentially political in
their bearing. 1t is not however to be inserted that there
was any difference in the penalty: the difference lay in the
