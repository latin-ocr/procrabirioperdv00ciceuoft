(b) 1t is impossible to give any more precise definition of

mllio by specifying any class or classes of actions to
which alone that oerm could strictly speaking be applied. 1
cannot find that the ancients themselves had any such defini·
tio-13 nor is such to be looked for‘ in the infancy of J‘uris-

peudence. At the same time it is to be observed that the
word needed no further definition. We hear of a law of

«ᾖ pitellio existing in the regal period; but it seems to have

dealt only with the procedure to be followed and the punish·
ment to be inflicted on the guilty. The truth is that in a
trial for perduellio the question raised was not so much a
question of fact as of intent or effect. If the people hold that
a citizen has by some course of action harmed or imperilled
the state, they find him guilty of perduellio: if not, they
aequit him. Thus, by being the ultimate judge of the quality⁸
of the action, the sovereign people is the guardian of its own
nfety and honour.

lt is only by holding fast this conception of perduellio that
we mn understand how it was that such a variety of offences
were able to be brought under it. We hear of many forms of
&ason directly political, both within the city, as attempts to
kin injure or impede in execution of duty the officers of the
state, misuse of magisterial powers, aiming at monarchy⁸,
and indeed conspiracies in genera13 also without the city, as
trensonable assistance of or correspondence with an enemy:
and of others not directly political but either military, as
ensa of cowardice neglect or other misconduct in the field3
or religious, as neglect of auspices etc; or such injuries as are
inflicted upon the state by violence used by a fraudulent con-
tractor to defeat the ends of justice: a strange though not
exhaustive list of offences, which had only this one point' in
common, that they were held to outrage the majesty and

cndanger the security of Rome.
