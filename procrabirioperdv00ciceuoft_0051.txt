the charge. As he cannot admit the
fact, he will go as sar as he can, and ad-

that Saturninus was rightsully put to
death. ἐξ 18, 19. [Here is a lacuna]

The desenoe is resumed in the form
of a narrative in which stress is laid
upon all the points in which any justifi-
cation can be found sor the conduct os
Rabirius on the ocoesion in question.
He only did what all the best men in
Rome did. He acted as a truc patriot
and accepted a responsibility which it
would have been cowardly to shirk. The
decisions of the law courts shew the
opinion os recognized public authorities
on the cause of Saturninus. To condemn
Rabirius now is to stain with ignominy
the names os all the men os whom Rome
was then proud—even that of her great
hero Marius, That Marius is dead, is
no answer to this: we should reverence
the dead, and honour as we would be
honoured. Besides, we know that the
real slayer os Saturninus has been al-
ready publicly recognized and rewarded.
