But by far the greater 'number of the trials for Μ
with which we are acquainted occurred in the Republiean
period, and the procedure was of a very different kind from the
above. Atthe risk of seeming tedious 1 venture to append a

Ι sketch of this procedure, without some account of which it is
impossible to understand the case of Rabirius and indeed
many others also. The matter of this chapter (Ο) ia mainly
