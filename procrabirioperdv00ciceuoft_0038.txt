os reperandae in 70 BC. In the accusatio composed by Cicero
occurs the following remarkable passage (11 in Verrem 1 §58—
¹4)· Cicero describes what he would have done had Verres
been acquitted in the court of repetundae. He says that is he
escape this, he will accuse him os peculatus (ξ ιι); is he escape
again, he will accuse him os maa'estas (ξ 12); is the J'ury in this
court also acquit him, he will bring him to the bar os the
Roman people itsels. from whose just indignation he will not
escape. Though the word perduellio is not used, there can be
no other interpretation os the threat. Verres· gross abuse os
his official powers, his scourging and putting to death Roman
citizens iniussu populu would easily have sufficed to establish
such a charge. The orator recurs to it again v ἐξ 173,178,
