text bears so small a proportion to the whole work as is here
the case, 1 seel' bound to explain my reasons for producing
it in such a state.

1 was driven to choose between two coursee, either to
Ine meoely a text with explanatory notes, or to attempt

, τω grapple with all the many difficulties that environ the

 

subiect. The former of these would be useless, and no
‘middle course seemed profitable. 1 have therefore made
the ambitious attempt to find some sound solution os all
the difficulties: but 1 am well aware that in so doing 1
bave undertaken an enterprise beyond my powers,

'flue speech is unique, and involves constitutional and
legal questions ol' the first importance to students os Roman
history, which have sor the most part to be answered by
painsul examination os meagre and sometimes conflicting
evidence. In the collection os this, and in the consultation
os the lengthy and osten ill-arranged treatises os modern
writers on the subject, 1 have found the volume os matter
increase upon me daily: and have at last been compelled
to leave σθ’ with the knowledge that some parts of my work
are in a painsully crude state. And this probably applies
sar more widely than 1 am awarc.
