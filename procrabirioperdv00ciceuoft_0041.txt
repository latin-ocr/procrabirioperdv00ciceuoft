*mate would be lovered and wakened by the loss os the
mon on which it had become aocustomed to rely, and·
&uby a great sear taken off ‘popular’ tribunes, whose de-
&ns the senate had been able to checkmate by the destruction
ἶ 'of the lender.
‘¹ ’ (c) It will be seen that the acts for commission of or
pufidpation in which somebody was to be brought to trial
ἶ ” were either lawsul and unpunishable or criminal in the highest
degree and rendering their perpetrator liable to the uttermost
ἶ punitio os the law. The real question was the constitutional
eneas to the quality os the acts. And as from the point os
view os the populares the slaughter os a tribune was a crime
exceptionally heinous it follows that the accusation could
only be brought under one os two heads,—maiestas or per-
Mb. But mat‘estas was tried in one os the permanent jury
coorto, the members os which, being taken from the wealthier
classes and representing⁸ the ‘party os order', were sure to
aequit a man aocuscd on that charge. There remained per·
Mb, in which two forms of procedure were possible-the
dilect tribunician, by the four hearingS‚ and the ancient one
by duumvir& subject to the right os appeal. Os these the
24 latter was chosen. probably with the view os more effectually
J ' srightening the senatorial party by means os the long-disused
barbarous penalty named in the ancient law.
(d) ‘rhe victim selected was old and insignificant. but in
all probability one who had in his time done' other deeds os
violence than that now laid to his charge, and so not without
cucutia. He had however hitherto escaped the hand of the
law. An accuser was found in the tribune T Atius Labienus,
ready to avenge the death os an uncle who had taken part
with Saturninus and lost his lise on that occasion. Labienus
then was to accuse Rabirius os perduellio before duumvirs.

(e) Such was the resolution os the democratic leaders.
