This Iex Sempronia seems to belong to the first tribimate
os C Gracchus, 12 3 Bc. His object in bringing forward such
a proposal was twosold. First, he had to revenge the death·
os his brother and the banishment' of a number os his nd·
herents ‘nae person principally aimed at was P Popillius
y Laenas, who had been president os the qrmesn’o mmor-dinam
by which the followers of Ti Gracchus had been tried. In
the second place he had to wi'n the favour of the people by
popular measures; and this law, prohibiting these trials by ἐ
special commissions except with the consent of the people, ,
was aimed directly at the assumption os such powers by the
senate.

That the appointment os such special commissione by the ᾗ
senate without the sanction os a popular vote was strictly
speaking an unconstitutional step, cannot be doubted. But
in this matter as in others by the gradual disuse⁸ os what m j}
a necessary condition os validity the senate had come to eon- ἶ
sider itsels entitled to act alone: is any demagogue attaeked
thern on this ground it was generally· possible to employ in ’ξ
their desencc the intercession of one tribune against another.
After the overthrow os the elder. Gracchus the nobles pro-
ceeded in this unconstitutional manner against the remaining
leaders os the popular party: and again in the ωδε os the
Catilinarian conspirators the senate formed ioeels into a sort
os High Commission to try thern. Even Cicero could only
defend this conduct on the ground that men who had been
declarcd public enemies could not claim the right tobe uctred
as citizens. ξ
