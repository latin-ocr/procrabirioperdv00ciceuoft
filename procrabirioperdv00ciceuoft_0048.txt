6. 1n§ ι we find desem-ab capittksamaesonmmnque
omnium, in ξ 3 supplicium, in ξ 5 dimicatio msam&
fortunarumque omnium, and have mention of Rabirio-⁹
salus to be preserved, and of his vita being καὶού on
the popular vote. [ἐξ 10—17 do not concern us δατ. and
have been dealt with above]. In ἐξ 3, 31 we hearof σψ-
cim, in § 3¹ capitis a‘tan'tur. But in the perorationi 5 36
we learn that Rabirius fears famae vulnus and imm
civium. 1n ξ 37 we have clear reference to exile, which
would deprive him of honourable death aad buria! at
home. Now we know what extravagant language
Cicero could employ when it suited him, and 1 do not
think that there is anything in all this to shew that
the life of Rabirius was really in danger⁸¹ from the result
of the trial at which this speech was delivered. The
peroration seems even in its fragmentary state to contain
evidence⁸⁸ to the contrary effect. And Cicero is apped-
ing for an old man (§ 2) who could not in the course of
nature (ἓ 37) live many more years. The real question
is, what connexion can there be between multae inv·
gatio'on the one hand and exile and infame& on the·
other? This 1 have considered in an appendix (K),
and arrived at the conclusion that there was such a
connexion in some cases at least. Holding this view,
1 cannot but regard the expressions in the perorationi
as sufficient to prove that the stronger ones which come
earlier in the speech are intentionally overdrawn. 1
cannot believe that the references to loss of mputprove ξ
the speech to have been delivered before the centurie. Ξ
or that the risk to Rabirius’ vita means any more than ἑ.
the possibility of a disastrous change in the conditione
of his lise.
