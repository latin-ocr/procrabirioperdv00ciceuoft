It seems that in early times the fines imposed by magis-
trates (multae datio) or named in laws were not allowed to
¹exceed the hals¹ os “ the offender's property. But it is certain
that in the fine-processes before the mmitia tributa this limita-

’ tion was not' observed. This may be explained byobeerving

that each multae irrogatio was a separate legislative act· aad
that the sovereign people could only be bound by the expres-
sion os its own will.

The simple multae dxi-tio brought‘ no infamae'a. Titemltae
according to Huschke⁸ is essentially a composition sor some
wrong done. But the multae irrogatio isan attempt to get ι
fine inflicted by the people‘,'and so to force the accused to
compound sor an offence which might have been dealt with υ
perduellio. Tbere is therefore strong a priori likelihood that
condemnation in such a fine-process would make a man
infamis. That a vote os the people in their centuriee should
deprive a man os all that made lise worth having, or even os
lise itsels, while a vote os the same given by tribes could inflict
a fine but involved no further consequences, is a position of
affairs hardly conceivable. Yet it seems to have been ω’ (at
least in theory) in the case⁸ of Menenius. But we are told
that he would not endure the disgrace put upon him.and died
os a broken heart. So too Livius Salinator· would not bear
