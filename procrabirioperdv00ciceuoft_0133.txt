Moreover, if we reflect that a fine was at first contem-

beginning have been regarded as very serious, and that a fine
was eventually imposed upon P Claudius Pulcher, we shall
have the utmost difficulty in believing that no infamia at-
bched to these culprits.

1 can say no more on this subject. The deficiency of
direct evidence is not peculiar to this question. Many of the
most important points in the constitutional history of Rome
present the same difficulty. Nor is this to be wondered at:
for the writers who might have made such questions clear
generally content themselves with passing reference or allusion
to matters that everyone would know, and of course they
could not tell to what details the interest of posterity would
tum.
