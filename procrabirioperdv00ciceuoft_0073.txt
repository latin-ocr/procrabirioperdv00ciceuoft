opposition. Compare pro Caecina

m] the name rex was regarded
viui a deep traditional hau-ed at
Rome. Hence orators sreely em-
ployed the artifice of imputing to
their opponents conduct only fitted
for a (tyrann) king. See de leg agr
n 5 ις, pro Sulla ᾖ ²¹-7· So we
might say ‘worthy os the Star
fflmber’. Cicero no doubt is
having ι fling at Labienus for
heving (like a king, eg Tullus)
practicam nominated the Duum—
vu's himself.

mullo] ‘judgment', ‘tact’‚
‘poliey'. Compare pro Sulla §4
(of Hortensius) hoc honore aneton·-
tau virtute consilio praeditum, div
inCaecil573. On the (presumed)
possession os this quality Cicero
especially prided himself. See the
cop he makes ιο fit himself in pro
*¹⁰¹8 ²⁴·

virtuto] - the sum os a man’s
excellencia moral or intellectual
or (as bere, l think) both. No
English word that l know of is
coextensive with ἰι. See its wide
use in de imp Cn Pomp ἐς 28—36.

autenm] personal weight, in·
fluente, authority.

ens depulsum] See inu-od Ε
(ι) and (stip.

ampla malorum] referring to
the irregularity in the appointrnent
of the duumviri, or perhaps ιο the
employment of that procedure at
all. See Introd B.

bees] probably he refers to tbe
Porcian and Sempronian laws men-
tioned above. But as 1 have already
remarked (ᾖ ιο) Cicero very well
knew that Rabirius would not bave
been scourged and put ιο death.

auctentum senatus] 1 think
this bears only the general meaning
os the ‘authority' os the senate,
that is, the sanction they had given
ιο the killing ol' Saturninus by de·
claring him a public enemy. See
on auctoritas senatus 5 2. So in
Pisonem 5 4 (referring ιο this very
case) he says senalus auctoritorem.
But hc may be speaking of their
opposition ιο Labienus' mensures.

religione· etc] probably Labie·
nus had disregnrded some flaw in
the auspices taken before the as-
sembly os the centurie& or tbe
notice οῖ a magistrate <such as Q
Metellus Celer the augur who was
praetor this year) that he intended
ιο watch the heavens for signs of
the divine will (dc caelo servare).
See philippic 11 §5 80--—i and
Mayor's notes. Or it may referto
Labienus' carrying liis rogatio in
the tribes sor a trial <1n1md Ε e) in
the leeth of all such obstacles,
