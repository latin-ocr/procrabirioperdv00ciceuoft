ἔς ad C Rabirium defendendum est adhortata. tum vero,
{511 , ut id studiosissime facerem, salus rei publicae, consulare
’ officium, consulatus denique ipse mihi una a vobis

cum salute rei publicae commendatus cocgit. non
enim C Rabirium culpa delicti, non invidia vitae, non
denique veteres iustae gravesque inimicitiae civium in
discrimen mpitis vocaverunt, sed ut illud summum

βιαία· os Cioero’s lise up to this
time had been to gain influente
1η the judicium employment of
his ments aa an advocate. Strictly
speaking he had not (as here im·
· plied) confined himself to desence.
He had conducted the prosecution
ο( Verre-3 but he uras at that time
a young man secking same, and he
'aa phying to vin the favour οἱ the
popular party. He was now attach-
ed to the senatorial party3 hence
hiadd'euoe of Rabirius. See gene-
‚rallyvhathe saysin pro Mur& 5,
8,9,deimp Cn Pomp& 1,2.
..l- τοί nubum etc] all this
aoundavery well, as in pro Mur
ξφ 5. 1t ia as a patriotic states·
man that he {eelz most impelled
to throv himself heartily (stradb-
uim'ne) into the work ot desence.
camalam mun] perhaps the
‘duty σί a conaul’ here refers
putimhny (aa Turnebus says) to
the duty os maintaining the right
ο( the Senate to issue the sctum
ubinam (sor which aee appendix
Α) and the validity o( the acta ot a
consul in virtueostheaame. Seeon
5 6 conquemduur, fi 9 aufidium.
malam ¹900] the obligations
of the consulship in thia respect
are prettily handled in pro Mur
S ι-ς.
ma vom] the word· nound aa

is they had originally stood in the
order a vobis una.

donea] this is a very mild ex·
pression for the offence with which
Rabirius stood charged. But on
what authority Suet Jul 12 calls
him praecipuus adfatur os the Sen-
ate in suppressing Saturninus 1
know not. For delicta, ‘munga'
or ‘torts’, aee Maine's Ancient
Lau c 10.

invidia vitu] ‘odium brought
on him by his lise’. ln Roman
trials this was a consideration os
the utmost importance. See pro
Mur ἐξ ιι-ι4, pro Sulla 5 ⁶9
omnibus in rebus, iude'ces, quae
graviores maioresque sunt, quid
quisque voluerit cogitarit admiserit
non a· crimine sed ex moribus
eius qui arguitur est ponderandum.
neque enin· potest quisquam nos·
trum subito fingi neque cuiusquam
repente vita mazara· aue natura
converti.

iustae] regular, ‘ven-grounded’.
We may then inser that Cicero at
least pretended to regard the
ground of enmity advanccd by
Labienus (the murder of hia uncie.
aee fi 14) aa insufficient to jususy
hia ins‘miciee'aee.

numum auxilium εις] referring
to the so-caned sctum ulamau, sor
which aee appendix Α.
