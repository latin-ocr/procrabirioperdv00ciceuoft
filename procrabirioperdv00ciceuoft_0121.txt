&murm-⁸⁸. This is the most explicit statement on the sub-
iect that has come down to us from any Latin author: and it
must therefore serve as our chief text in the following enquiry
meaning the contents os the law.

(1) It seems to have reenacted (a) the provisions os the
Valerian laws¹¹ on provocatio, as may be gathered from

and (b) provisions resembling those of the Porcian¹⁸ laws, by
a general prohibition of the penalty os death, as is to be
gath-:red from the passages¹⁸ of Cicero and Sallust relating to
the Catilinarian affair.

free Roman citizen, by a quaestio extraordinaria without the
consent os the people.

(3) Tite difficulty now meets us in the attempt to dis-

have been some new provision in the law. Yet it does seem,

relates to the liability os offending magistrates, already in
