tud brought under the cognizance of a quaestio perpetua¹⁸.

 

 

The precise date of this step 1 am unable to determine. The
passage in the rheortical treatise addressed to Herennius
seems certainly to refer to a time when the offence had been
defined, and we may probably assume that the quaestio per-
ma peculatus was already in full course of work. The
treatise is assigned ¹' to the year 84 Bc or later. This inclines
me to think that the court was already established before
ὼε dictatorship of Sulla, and not in the first instance by a
la* Cornelia of that legislator. Indeed the existence of a Iex
Cornelia dc peculatu is nowhere (so far as Ι, can discover)
ditectly attested, and Lange¹⁸, who hesitatingly assumes it,
seems to make out but a weak case. The a priori likelihood
of such an enactment proceeding from Sulla I. do not deny.
All 1 can admit for certain is that the standing court was in
existence before Bc 70, the year os the trial of Verres.

(3) As to the penalties inflicted on the guilty in earlier
times we have no satisfactory information. Probably they
varied according to the degrees of guilt in the accused and
punishment called for by the accuser. Restitution would no
doubt be enforced by a money fine3 whether of greater
amount than the peculations, is not certain. This would
probably be accompanied¹⁴ by infamia, and (in very bad cases
at least) by aquae et ignis interdictu) and confiscation of the
offender's property. Of the effects of conviction under the
quaestio perpetua we have fuller knowledge. The condemned
criminal lost his civic rights and became infamis. Besides
this, exile—voluntary in theory—might¹⁸ be enforced by aquae
