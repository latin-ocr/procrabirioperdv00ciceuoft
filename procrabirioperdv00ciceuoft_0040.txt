, (a) C Rabirius an aged senator was brought to nial· early

in Bc 63 sor the murder os Saturninus Thirty six suu years
had gone by since that turbulent demagogue had been cut ofl'
by authority os the senate. Rabirius had consessedly taken
part in the suppression os the rising os Saturninus, and had
according to one account afterwards shewn a needless md

to have been proved or even probable that it was he who
struck⁸ the fatal blow. Indeed a slave had been· publidy
recognised as the slayer os Saturninus and duly rewarded
