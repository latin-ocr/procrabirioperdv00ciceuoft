that the matter offfi 11—16 must have filled a far more
considerable place in the speech before the centuries.
Surely there would have been no less said about the
cruelty of Labienus' proposals, probably far more about
the obsoleteness of the ancient procedure, and the

· irregular nomination of the duumvirs must have been
“ one of the main points o'f attack. But this last is in
our speech only msually referred to in ξ 12.

⁴- whether the contio mentioned in ξ 25 be one in
which Cicero is at the time¹' speaking, 1 cannot say.
Huschke¹' is confident that it is. 1 am inclined to think
that it refers to one of the earlier hearings of what 1
belleve to have been a fine-process. The words quam
tu habes would prove Huschke's view right were there
not quod habuit domi suae in the preceding section.

5. ’Πιε half-honr limit (ἐξ 6, 9), assigned by Labi·
enus* to the speech of Cicer0, suits better with proce-
dure before the tribes (where the tribune could preside)
than with that before the centuries. Or it may be
an indication that the speech was delivered before a
contio at one of the three preliminary hearings of a
popular trial. If 80, and the passage ᾗ 17 liberum tem-
pus dabitur etc be rightly referred to a forecast of
the fuller speech on the occasion of the fourth hearing,
then the supposition' that this speech falls in one of the
antimus· of the fine-process gains great probability. But
1 am in doubt on this point. The llmitation was pro·
bably in any case an arbitrary act, but it was clearly
based on the tribune's power of intercessio ,· and this we
know could be exercised⁸‘ in any assembly.
