(ι) Porcius Laeca was probably an adherent of the ⁴

nobility, or he would not have been made¹¹ oneo( the ’

tresviri epulones who were then (first time) appointed,
doubtless under aristocratic influence. Now the benefit

of the new law tested, as will be seen, almost entirely
with the travelling capitalists. It is quite inconsistent ⁴
with what we know¹⁸ os the character and σιω of f

Cato that he should have proposed a measure to πῆξαι

the control os these gentry by the provincial governors. ⁴,

The law is therefore 'more probably to be regarded as a
crafty move os his opponents. They outbid¹’ him in
the quest os popularity by carrying further the principle
which he had made his own and consequently omud
not oppose [And the selection of a Porcius as their
tool sor this purpose would have about it an imnieal
plausibility eminently Romam]

(2) So sar as can be gathered by a not tootimid
inserence from a solitar-y fact, it appears that the prin·
cipal enactment os this law was the extension οἷ the
privilege granted in that os Cato to all citizens living or
carrying on civilian pursuits in Italy beyond the mile
radius and in the provinces, At least we know that
such an extension did take place* in the case os the
provinces, and from this we may argue a sambri to
Italy. Indeed the spread ol' empire and dispersim of
large numbers os citizens travelling on business ⁸about
so many countries had made the old mile limit an
absurdity. Its original intention had no doubt been
to reserve the sun imptrinm to the general in the field.

(3) That we do not hear os a single case of a pro·
vincial governor being impeached⁸¹ before the people
sor a breach os this law, is easily accounted sor. The
governors knew better than to vent their displeasune on
