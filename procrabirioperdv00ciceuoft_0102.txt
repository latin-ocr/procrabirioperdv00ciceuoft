et ἡμεῖς interdisteb. And in cases os peculatus as in thone os
rmtundae the jury were called upon to hold a second enquiey*
in order to fix the amount os money penalty to be demanded
by way os restitution. Whether an equal or multiple velue
was exacted. 1 cannot learn; but 1 am inclined to conjectum
that it was double the amount os the peculation. as wau the
case in tentandae under a clause¹' os the lex Acilia Thin

in the first trial been unable or unwilling to acquit; and they
not seldom availed themselves os it.
