become impossible to refuse this, and so the patricinns lost
their chief motive for resisting the extension of the tribuniciae
powers in this direction. Hence it is that, when once the
legislative power of the tribes becomes coordinate with that
of the oenturies, we find the tribunes acting as accuser: in
capital trials before the latter body· without any oppositioni
from the patricians. No doubt these last reflected that it was
better to be brought before the centuries than the tribes„ it
’ being so much more difficult to secure a condemnation.

(c) We now pass on to consider the division of a airuilul
trial before the people (iudicium populi> into the pmoeeding
in iure and that in iudicio. The view of Zumpt” is that the
in iure division is found under three forms for different pur·
poses or at different dates. There are (1) the sctum of the
early Republic, doubtless not granted without careful iuquiry,
(2) the preliminary procecding before the magistrate in cue·
of ‘ordinary' or non-political trials, (3) the proceeding before
the magistrate and the hearings before the people down to
the end of the third hearing, the procedure employed in the
‘extraordinary’ trials, those of political import. It is with
the details of these ‘extraordinary’ trials that we are oon-
cerned here. Now the view of Zumpt is open to this obiec-
tion. The three hearings referred to were conducted before
the whole body of citizens assembied in ωητὶο, and these
citizens arc also the ultimate judges in the case: besides
witnesses are produced on ali three occasions. This is very
unlike what wc know of other proccedings in iure, and it in
perhaps safer in the grievous dearth of evidence to hold tint
the first appearance of the accused before the accusing magis·
tratc is the true in iure procccding in such cases. Then the
first three hearings will count as parts of the proceeding in
