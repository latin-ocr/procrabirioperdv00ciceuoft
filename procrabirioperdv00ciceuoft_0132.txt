lt will be observed that in the cases οἰ Menenius and
Livius cited above we are told that the victitn withdrew indig-
nantly into voluntary exile. ἸΊιε same is reported¹·os Camil·
lus. And it is surely probable that, as the tribe auembly

oeme to be more and more employed as a court os uimine!
jurisdiction‚ means would be found to drive the condemned

into exile.. This was most likely at first accomplished by iin- ’ ἱ

posing a fine os great amount, in the hope that the offender
would be unablc¹⁸ either to pay or find sureties (praeda) {or
payment os the same, and so become liable to arreet aad
imprisonment. To avoid this he would probably fly stom
Roman territory. The practice once begun would thu by
these or other means be kept up and become regular through

use.

Further. Ι would in dealing with this question generally
follow the line os argument taken by a great modern authority⁰
in speaking os the competente os the jury courts and their
relation to the tribe assembly.

Now the decline of the Republic was exactly the period
during which the Quaestiones Perpetuae were established. ιο that
the statutes creating them were all passed by a legislative υκαι·
bly which itselt' could not, at its ordinary tittings, punish ι
criminal with death. lt followed that the permanent Judieial
commissions, holding a delegated authority, were citemusenbed
in their attributes and capacities by tbe limits os the power·
residing with the body which deputed them. They could do
nothing which the Assembly οἱ the Tribes could not have dones
and, as the Assembly could not sentence to death, the Quaestione·
were equally incompetent to award capital punishment.

Though the notion os delegated authority is here perhaps
too definitely and strictly conceived¹⁸ to be quite accurate. it
