We have now to consider the cour-ts before which cnse· of

perduelli& were brought, and the procedure employed. The
earliest case recorded—that of Horatius—is said to have been
tried by duumviri. We hear of such in one account of the

- condemnation of Manlius, and we know that Rabirius w

brought before such a commission. The following points in
connexion with them deserve mention.

(a) They were probably an extraordinary² 00me
not a standing court of justice. Indeed it is inconceivable
that they could have been the latter in the time of the king&

(b) We do not know that the king was obliged to appoint
them. 1 am inclined to think with Lange· that he was non
but that, if he for any reason shrank from exercising in any
case the plenary jurisdiction which he had in virtue of his
imperium. he could and did appoint such commissionem, fmm
whose sentence there was an appeal to the people in their
curies, while from that of the king himself there was none.

(c) What was the form which the appointment denoted
by the word ‘sacch' took, is not certain. lt may bave been
that of direct nomination by the king. But it is perhaps
more probable⁸ that the king announced his intention of
laying the case before commissionem. who were then by his
permission chosen by the curies. This would agree with the
story that Manlius was condemned through (ptr-through
the intervention or agency of) duumvirs duly elected (cenati)
to conduct the enquiry; and also with Cicero's objection (ἦ 12)
to the nomination of the two who tried Rabirius as legally
null.

(d) lt is not certain· why they were two in number.
