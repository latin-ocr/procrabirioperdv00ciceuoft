duty (in the early times when we hear of it) had probably
nothing official¹’ about it, it is to be noted that the passages
upon which this view rests are chiefly such as are referred to
above on (3), which give no such inference when fairly re-
garded, or such as Tac ann xl 22, which only speaks in
general terms¹¹ of the recovery by ⁴the equites of a share in the
isadicia. ”lt may also be asked how it comes that, if there was
an office of this name important enough to be held by quim,
we still have no reference to any function as falling within its
competence.

(9) As to the date at which the m’buni aerarii became
recognized as an ordo¹⁸‚ we have no materials that enable us
to determine it even approximately. The reference in pro
Rabirio ὃ 27 has been explained by Madvig to menn that
men who in 63 Bc were equites and tribuni aerarii had as
young men in 100 Bc taken part in the suppression of Satur-
ninus. But this interpretation, which seems to me a very
forced one, has boen rejected by Mommsen and Becker. Ι
venture to think that the members of those ordines at the time
are meant, even as the senatus and nobilitas of ἐξ 20, 21 are
the senators etc of that tIme. If this be so, it will follow that
(a) the tribuni aer-arrii were already an ordo in 100 Bc, and*

consequently (b) were not first recognized as such by the lex
Aurelia of 70 BC.
