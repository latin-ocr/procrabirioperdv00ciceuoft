adiourn the further hearing of the cese to a day fixed by
himself. The day was already fixed by the consul or (acconi-
ing to later practice) the praetor* urbanus, from whom the a
accuser had in the first instance to ask for the appointment of
a day for holding a meeting of the comitib σιωπήσω, to give
the final decision. And a certain interval⁸' had to be lest
between thia day of formal assembly and the end of the in·

issue¹⁸ upon which they would be required to pass jndgment.

to judge of the feeling of the people, and so to draw up his
indictment as to have the best chance of procuring the con·

in the forum for all to see during a space of three maritet
