that this proceeding was possible because the sentence thus
passed, though in effect capitae, was regarded not as a Manu
in the strict sense but only as a public recognition* of a state
of fact. A correct view os this proceeding is most important,
, particularly to readers os Livy, sor many os the case· in which
