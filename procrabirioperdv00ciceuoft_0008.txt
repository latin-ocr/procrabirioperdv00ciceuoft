‘me study os this speech and oi the interesting questions
connectedtherewithwillbeerpeciallyusesultostudents
oonoerned with the history os the iuda-th publium to under·
stand which some knowledge os the earlier indidit mle·
is required. And addreesing mysels as 1 do to elder
students 1 have throughout mumed that nobody will read
the book who has not a sair acquaintance with the outline
os Roman history and constitutional antiquitiee. 1 have
therefore made free use os technical language, which ie
necessary is one is to discuss intrioete and obscure questions
within a reasonable compass.

The merits os the speech are plain to any that vm
consider the position os affairs at the time os its delivery.
Party hatred, sostered by desperate men, was ready to break
out into violence at any moment; and the impeachment
and desence os Rabirius were ominous os the coming sturm.
1 have in my notes on the speech striven to call attention
to the cle'ver audacity oi the speaker, os which there are
many notable instances.

1n the endeavour to make my meaning clearer 1 have
used an elaborate system οἷ grouping. by which 1 hope the
questions treated in the Introduction and appendice· may
bc kept from mutually obscuring and intersering with one
another. 1 have made a practice os giving either by way
ol* reference or in sun quotation the authorities sor the
statements upon which my conclusions are based. This is a
very tedious business3 and many a time have 1 wished that
1 could afford to say with Madvig ⁸ iiberhaupt habe ich alles
weggelaxsen, was nur zum Prunk der Gelehrsamlreit gehbrt'.
But os course l could not do this. and can only hope that
l have not overloaded the book with irrelevant matter.

To Me J S Reid os Gonville and Caius College Iowe
and hereby render my heartiest thanks. Hc read the whole
book through in proos and sent mc most valuable notet
