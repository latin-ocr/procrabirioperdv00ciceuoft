aneton-itu temtus] it is well
known that, when the passing os a
regular consultum was prevented
by the &arcessis os a tribune, the
sententia which had obtained a
majority was called auctoritas. See
sor instance: ad fam 1 2 §4754
and the remarks in Wordnwonh’s
Fragments and Specimenn pp ⁴16
—8. But 1 do not feel sure that
the word is not sometime· loosely
appiied to a sctum proper. u in de
legibus m 5 37 we find senatus
vetus auctoritas de Bacchanalibus
referring to what Livy xxxix ¹858
upmsly cans consultum. On the
occasion os which Cicero is here
speaking it is not clear how it could
have been technicnny auctoritas.
indeed in ἦ 20 it is called consut-
tunae. Doubues· Saturninus would
have veioed the motionz but he
vas in the Capitol with his follow-
ers: and the rest of the tribunes
(κο on ‚Q 20) were in accord with

the senatorial majority. Pedum it
merely means ‘authoritss ‘just in-
antaee, as iu de legibus m 5 ²7

tonus. See ⁰¹¹5 17.

mand '‚ which originally eanfled
with it the power of use and dach
m essentiany of a military mun
and only certain classes oc magis-
trates possessed it. The uiuunt·
