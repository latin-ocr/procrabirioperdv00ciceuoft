(3) Into the details of the famous case of M Manlius
(384 nc) it is unnecoesary to go. The account in Livy is
most confused. What is to our purpose is the version of the
story in which the duumvir-s appear. We are told that they

Α were elected. But whatever were the preliminary steps it is

now pretty well agreed that there was only one real trialffndi-
cium) and that this was before the centuries. Probably some
misunderstanding of an early narrative of the three hearing!
has caused the confusion in Livy's narrative. Manlium
put to death. See Livy vl 20 with Weissenborn’s notes, aad

(4) Α notable case is that of P Claudius Pulcher who .
with heedless levity disregarded the auspices and gave battle
to the Carthaginian fleet off Drepana, in which action he
was defeated with terrible loss. He was brought to trial (248
Β c) for perduellio, and must have been condemned but for a
storm which stopped proceedings at the fourth hearing. The
renewal of this accusation was barred by the intervention of
tribunes. So he was brought before the tribes and fined 1000
asses for every ship lost. See Schol Bob quoted above. Cic

(5) Very interesting is the attempt made to bringM 1²oe-
tumius Pyrgensis the contractor (publicemus) to trial on a
charge of perduellio for the violence used to prevent condem·
nation for malaeus. But he forsook his sureties and bolted.
So the Tribes dealt with him as aelf-condemned in his absence.

(6) The case of Cn Fulvius in 211 BC is also important.
He had when praetor been in command of an army. This

he lost in a battle, where he himself shewed great eomrdioe.
