muriam. This was to indicate that watch and ward was

, ’ being duly kept at that post by a guard set there sor that

purpose. For inasmuch as the centuries met outside the city

⁵ wall, and represented the armed soree* os the Roman people,

it w dangerous to leave the city in their rear exposed to the
attack of an enemy, whose first step would be to occupy the
Janiculum. No further business could be transacted⁸ at the
meeting when the hauling down os the ensign announced the
withdrawal of the guard. He adds that the custom was still
kept up in his time from religious motives.

Macrobius sat 1 16 ξ 15 speaks of triginta dies‘ quibus
exercitui imperato vatillum russi coloris in arce positum est.
Livy XXXIX 15 § 1 1 says cum vexillo in arce posito comitiorum
musa aercitus eductus esset.

There is here an apparent disagreement as to the spot
where the guard and flag were planted, sor at Rome arx
usually denoted the eitadel on the Capitoline: and srom the
place of assembly in the Campus Martius both the Capitoline
and the Janiculum would be visible. But there can I think
be little doubt that Weissenborn is right‘ in taking arx to
mnd sor the Janiculum in this connexion. That this was
traditionally a menaced point os strategic importance is clear
from the story os Cocles in Livy 11 ιο ἓξ 3, 4. And the word
am· is used of it (though quite untechnically) in 1 33 ξ 6.
Lange however (Rom Alt 1 555) seems to incline to the view
that the arx in question was that commonly so called on the
Capitoline.
