- The following points also deserve attention, though the
evidence does not warrant the drawing of certain conclusions.

(6) 1t is probable that their ordo was—at all events aster

- ’ the passing of the Iex Aurelia—based' like that of equites on a

 

definite oensus footing. For not only would this be very natu-
nl in itself and in accordance with Roman precedent, but we
know that when Augustus added a fourth decem'a' he took its
numbers from a class defined by census. It is thus almost
certain that the same principle was acted upon throughout.

(7) It is probable that their name was inherited from the
&huni aerarii of whom we have mention· as existing in
ancient times. These seem to have been persons entrusted
with the duty of receiving the tributum (which was raised tri·
buliu) and payingthe money to the soldiers as stipendium.
ln the later days of the Republic the raising of tributum
oensed and the stipendium was paid through the quaestors. It
is therefore not to be wondered at that we find no mention of
m'buni aerarii again until the time of Cicero. They may
bave been in some sense a survival of the agents employed in
ancient times. But how they came to outlive the loss of their
functions, how they became an ordo at all, whether they were
iu any way connected with the curatores tribuum mentioned
by Vnum—these questions, though interesting in themselves,
admit of no definite answer in the present state of the evi·
dence3 indeed they are mere matters of baseless speculation.

(8) The opinion of Mommsen, that they were men os eques-
trian ansus who had served the office of tribunus aerarius, is
open to several objections. Passing over the point that this
