caprice prejudice and party or persona! hatred.1t was not
an enduring⁸ condition, but had to be renewed each time by

the new censors. But the man so degraded on one omniun·

might be reinstated by the next censors in his full privilegetz
or the two censors might disagree. and what one had done lus
colleague would readily undo. There were various degree-⁸
os this degradation. Probably the ius honorum was in any

- case lost. But in other respects it seems that the centon in-

flicted more or less disgrace (as senatu movere sequax vadem
iubere, trzbu mor vere, aerarmm facere) according to their σω·
ception os deserts and the rank os the offender. They need
not act in recognition os existing infamia, or os a judicu!
decision os any kind3 public rumour was enough. The ςυσ-
menia was not strictly speaking' a penalty, nor the censor'n
decision a iudicium. It should be added that the mnu·
lost ius suffragy' altogether, while the man tribu mom in the
milder sense· (transferred from a rural to a city tribe) got ι
worse vote. The aemn'us remained liable' to army service.
though not in the legion, and also was exposed to arbitrary
taxation.

It seems then that the man infamis gives the name to hi·
condition os infirmia, while on the other hand the impoeed
condition os ignom'm‘a makes a ‘man a‘gnomim'osns.
