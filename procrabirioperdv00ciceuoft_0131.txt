ω by his own hand to avoid the disgrace os a condemnation.

lajan the-e cas-s the word used by the Latin writers is {gm-
αἰαὶ in its general sense. There is no infamis, nothing with

‹ . 'meh legal consequences are bound up. But it seems clear

 

that when a fine-process was regarded as os an essentially
erimina] nature the matter would probably be taken up by the
next oensors¹' and a real technioel ignominia imposed on the
offender. Gradually popular sentiment'¹ came to regard these
elimina! fine-processes as necessarily bringing disgrace on the
condemned. At last we frnd a step taken towards the direct
recognition os this. ln 104 Bc was passed the lex Cassia ol*
the tribune L Cassius Longinus os which Asconius¹⁸says quae
populi iudicia firmavit. He adds that Cassius oerried a nurn-
ber os laws to weaken the power os the nobles, in quibus hanc
etnim ret, quem populus abmnasset‘ mive imperium abrogasset¹⁴‚
in senatu non esset. ’Πιε law was aimed chiefly at Q Servilius
[Caepio] consul two years before, who had been deprived os
his command by the people because os his defeat by the
Cimbri. It manifestly imposed a certain degree os infamia.
We shall now 1 think be justified in declaring it probable that
in the later times os the Republic men fined by sentence
os the tribes—at least sor heinous offences—lost somewhat
os their repnte and standing as citizens and became so sar

infames.
