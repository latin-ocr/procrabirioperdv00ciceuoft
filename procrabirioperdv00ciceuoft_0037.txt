Q anub called for a capital prosecution. When the tribune

boland his intention os turning the fine· ·procoes into a capital
&the accused demurred, but the other tribunes declared

the proceeding legal. The accuser then got a day fixed sor
anina mtun'ata. Fulvius found all his hopes vain, and went
into voluntary exile, which was then approved and confirmed

by the tribea. See Livy xxw 3, Zumpt 1 2 pp 272, 313, 341,

(7) The case of Q Pleminius (204 Bc) should be read in
Livy xxix 8, 9, 16—22. Τὴε commission sent to enquire into
:31 his impieties and cruelties at Locri was accompanied by two
- tribunesc and it was probably these two who accused Plemi-
nius and his abettors when brought to Rome, on a charge
most likely os perduellio. It seems that the comitia sor the

Zumpt 1 2 pp 203, 343—4, Lange 11 5²3·

(9) The accusation to avoid which P Popillius Laenas
went into exile was probably one os perduellio. See appendix
F and Zumpt 1 2 pp 346—7.

(ιο) So doubtless was that os L Opimius who, acting on
the utum ultimum, suppressed the movements of C Gracchus
