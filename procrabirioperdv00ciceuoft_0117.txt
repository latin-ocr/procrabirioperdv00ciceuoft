’ ω lt is just worth mentioning that while he lays great strecs on the
'udo-niuniu pro nab 5 12,andbases argumentsthereon, he finds it
unvenient to overlook item in San Cat 51 5 22, and to force a distinction
neven oppositioni between the lex Pom’a and the alias leges both there

(4) He considers it most probable that the valuable exemption
granted by these laws was not extended to an citizens but only to the
metm inre, that is those who had the ius honorum. He argues that
certain oasa* ol* these degrading punishments are known to us, in which
the afferet: were pretty certainly citizens, and in some os them we are
distinctly told so. But they probably had not the ius honorum.

[This is possible, perhaps probable, though not exactly proved. 'ste

three lam is that the first exempted citizens in Rome from the degrading
penalties whether they appealed to the people or not, the second dealt
with citizens abroad, and the third was really pro tergo clvium as
torbidding scourging altogether.

[He admits that one might go on gne-sing some time at this rate.
And surely these would not so readily bear the appearance of one law as
those reconstructed by lange]

(7) He thinks that the gravis poena mentioned by Livy as contained
in the sanctio of the Porcian law was nothing else than a clause declaring
that ι transgressor m liable to the penaltie· of perduellio, in fact that he
