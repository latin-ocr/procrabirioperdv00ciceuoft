' 'lffleloeFabt‘adeplagiaritlr' was most likely passed in the

hat century os the Republic, or a little earlier; and it con-

fland to be much used and commented on in the imperial
{ss vune. It dealt with· the ofi'ence os kidnapping concealing
dunning buying selling etc (a) a Roman citizen sreeborn or

ΜΦ) a free Latin (c) the slave of another man—the

une being done with knowledge and dolo malo. The trials

under this law were so far as we ean gather always iudicia

publiu- The penalty following on conviction was at one

time a money fine, but it was afterwards made more severe
and varied, according to the rank and quality os the offender,
{mm a fine with banisbment sor lise to crucifixion or slavery
in the minet. The money fine was naturally accompanied by
&samia

How the offence had been dealt with before the lex Fabia
it not cumin: possibly (as Rein suggests) variously according
to circumstances, either by a hadal-tiam populi or by the in·

terdict de homine libem exhibendo or by actio furti or actio

mvi mpti.

‘nne mere fact of there being need of such a law speaks
volume· ts to the horrible condition os Italy, both social
and economic, in the age aster the Punic wars.
