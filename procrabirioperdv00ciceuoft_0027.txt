The hindranoes' just· referred to were in general as

(ι) The ium& os a tribune. This might of
cornuue be employed to stop proceedings at any stage.
⁷- But it was not customary to employ it at the pre-
= liminary hearings. This means os protection sor the
’.πυραὶ was probably not very osten employed, and
was anyhow too capricious in its action to be os any
certain use in furtherance of justice.

(2) An obstructive policy on the part os the accused
and his supporters. This would sor the most part take
the form os an effort to ‘talk out the motion’ (dicendo
ὀίεαι minere or consumere etc). It is to be remembered
that there was a long day’s work to be got through in
any case. The assernbly of the centuries sor voting
was preceded by the fourth contio, and was even by
itsels a most clumsy apparatus at all times.

(3) Unsavourable auspices, obnuntiatio, and the
occurrence os any phenornena regarded as ominous. It
is unnoeessary to dwell at any length on this familiar
mbject.

(4) The removal os the red flag, whether as a bona
fide warning os an enemy’s approach or as a dodge in
the interest os the aocuscd. See appendix 1.

(5) The absence os the accused on some good
gr'oumi (e g accusatio morht). 1t seems that it tested
with the aocusing tribune· to decide whether an excuse
was valid or not, his decision not being final unless
approved by the consent, or silence os his collcagucs.

3 So many chance· had even the guiltiest crimina! os escap-
Ϊκέ ing punishment without acquittal.

⁵ (i) Another case remains to be dealt with. that os a man
v who went into voluntary cxsse' at some time during the
