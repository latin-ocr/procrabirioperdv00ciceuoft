Labienus istreated asaccuser. Nowsofarasweknow
the procedure by duumvirs froin the only case recorded
-that os Horatius—it seems that the appeal from their
decision introduoed a direct contest“ between them and
the accused. In fact they are the accusers. Now‚how-
ever unwilling Cicero may have been to make any re-
ference to Caesar, he mn hardly have avoided doing so
in the speech before the centuries. This he would very
likely tone down in a subsequent edition, but 1 do not
think that he would omit* it altogether. The auctor
huius iudai os ξ 33 might be Caesar, but is more
probably Labienus», who by a rogatio had originally set
on soot the trial.

Such is the evidence, scattered meagre and inconclusive,

⁴0„ which a conclusion has to be based. 1 have endeavoured

to state it fairly: and 1 think that the delicate balance os
probability inclines to the side 1 have taken. 1 hold that the
speech edited and preserved by Cicero was one in which he
felt that he had done justice to his powers, his effort in a
cause won. whether* Labienus withdrew from the trial after
this speech, or whether a vote was taken and Rabirius saved,
1 cannot say. But that he was saved 1 cannot doubt. 1
have now only to acknowledge with gratitude my debt to
Profe-sor Huschke, to whom 1 owe so much of the help ne-
cessary in treating of this very difficult subject.
