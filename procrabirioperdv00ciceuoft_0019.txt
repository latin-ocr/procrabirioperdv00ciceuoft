lange regards them as representativoe of the Ramnes and
Tium, which would agree well with his theory of the Alban
orhln οῖ the Luceres. On this point 1 will not offer an

kppublic m the Regal period.

; (e) 1t seems that iurisdiction was exercised, or at least
samoe pronounced‚ by one* only: and that they cast lots
to determIne on whom the duty should sall,

: (s) That the duumviral procedure lived on into the
gf Republiean age seems probable, though the traces os it are
slight and soettered. Huschke points out that we very often
henr os two tribunes accusing, and suggests that perhaps they
acted as duumvirs. Lange· thinks that the quaestors in the
mse os Sp Cassius may have done so.

(g) In any case we know that the trial by duumvirs
became obsolete' long before the time os Cicero. It' is clear
that this antiquated form os trial was revived simply as a
convenient means os securing a triumph sor the so-called
popular' party by impugning through the condemnation os
Rabirius the validity os the sctum ultimum. It is worth
ἵὲξέ noting that we have distinct mention of duumviri perduel-
ζίοηὶι· only in the three cases os Horatius Manlius and
Rabirius.
