v⁴rissrgentiam desiderant intellegis mihi semihoram istam
nimium longam fuisse: illam alteram partem de nece
Saturnini nimis exigmm atque angustam esse voluisti:

quae non oratoris ingenium, sed consulis auxilium im-
plorat et flagitat. 10. nam de perduellionis iudicio,

, quod a me sublatum esse criminari soleS, meum crimen

αι, non Rabiri. quod utinam, QuiriteS, ego id aut
primus aut solus ex hac re publica sustulissem! utinam
boc. quod ille crimen esse volt, proprium testimonium
meae laudis oeset! quid enim optari potoet quod ego
mallem quam me in consulatu meo carnuficem de soro,

thus carrying on semihoram to exi-

α’ support that a consul is bound
cogive-which 1 take to be the full
meaning of these words—is 1 think
tim maintensnce os the imperium
in its plenitude os power, acting
under the commissioni os the senate,
which follows from the justificationi
of the nctsol' Marius. So Turne-
bus had understood it· See on

had used every effert to prevent
the trial os Rabirius mking place

Labienus msy in bis speecbes and
common talk have put some such
colour on the consul's action ss he
is bere represented to have done.

knew that Rabirius would in no
case have been actually put to
death; but be makes the most os
this in order to excite compas-
