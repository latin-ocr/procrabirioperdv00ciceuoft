2 G. OF ‘rue rmewvt aemam.
In the year 70 Bc the praetor L Aurelius Cotta carried·

’ a law sor the ‘reform os the criminal courts. By this he de·

prived the senators os that exclusive right os sitting on iuria
which had been restored to them by Sulla. But he did not
simply divide this power equally between the senators and
equites: he ordained that each jury should consist os three
panels (Δαυνίαν, one os senators one of equites one os tribuni
aerarii. Os these last we can only be said to know the follow·
ing facts.

(1) They were recognized as aclearly marked class(ordo)
os citizens. The way in which they are spoken os· proves
this.

” (2) They were a numerous class, or they would not have
been able to supply a sufficient number os competent jurors.

(3) Tbey were closely connected with the equitem sor not
only are they generally mentioned as acting in sun sympathy
with them, but in passages⁴ where nothing turns on the dis·
tinet mention os the third decuria we find the term equa'oes
used to include both.

(4) They were (as we should expect) not confined to
Rome. but were some os them resident* in municipia.

(5) Their judicial sunction was taken from them· by
Julius Caesar.
