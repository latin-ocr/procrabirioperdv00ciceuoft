· Both these words are used in the general sense of ‘dis-
Μ’ ⁴dishonour'. But they have also a special and technical
neme which requires notice, and may be best brought out by
oumidering the relations between the tw0. These seem to be
as follows.

(a) &samia is the condition os the infamis. Such a con-
dition necessarily results from certain antecedents, such as¹
condemnation in a turpe iudai-ium, following some 'dishonoura·

struck out.

(b) ignominia is the consequence⁴ of the notio animad-
