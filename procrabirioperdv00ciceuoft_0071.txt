malim] which of the works
pas-ing under this name are here
mant 1 cannot venture to say.
But 1 rather think he means the
oldehronieles of the early writers
aad the records of the pontifis and
oensors etc in a general sort of way.
rather than any one set of records
in particular. See pro Murg 16.

reum mentulis] the an·
dent kings were supposed to have
kept books of notes or minutes of
their mamintus. lf any books
existed in Cicero’s time bearing
this title, they were surely forge·
ries. Such references to them as
'eliud in Livyi 3158,6o§4
have of course no authority what·
ever. But we see that there as
here they are spoken of as being
consulted for precedents. See
Mommsen, Ram Staatsrecht 1 p 3
note.

maiacum] here and in ἐξ 16,
3ο we may see how the meaning
developes itself : ‘terms ' - what
you have to expect-‘prospeet'. See
on 8 6, and compare 11 in Verrem v
3 ¹57. pro Cluent §5 ¹²9· ¹50·

ἕ 16. ignominis] here used ge·
nerally of the ‘disgrace' following
on eriminal trials, as often. For

the technical sense see appen-
dix H.

indideram pnhueomm] that is.
trials held under the quaestiones
perpetuae. This trial of Rabirius
on appeal to the people is a iudi·
cium populi, a very different thing.

omnum] ‘banishment’ in the
strict sense was nota penalty. Thus

-in pro Caecina 5 1οο he says ex-

silium enim non supplitium est sed
perficgium portusq ue supplici,· nam
qm· volunt poenam aliquam sub-
tetficgere aut calamitatem, eo solum
vertunt, hoc es! sedem ac locum
mutant. itaque nulla in lege
nostra reperietur, ul apud ceteras
civitates, maleficium ullum exsilio
esse multatum. See the passage,
and Jordan's note. Cicero must
therefore here mean ‘exile ¹ either
(a) voluntary, in order to escape
punishment, or (b) after condem-
nation. when that was followed up
by a bili brought before the people
ul aqua et igni ‹lamnam› interdi-
cer-etur. See appendix C, lntrod
C (i).
