include the theft os any kind os state property. As instance!
of paulatus in this wider sense we can point to cases' of min·-
appropriation os the booty or war-indemnity by victorious
generals, embezzlement os public moneys by state offioets to
whom they had been entrusted sor public purposes, os corn
and money by provincial governors, of sacred objects statue·
